* Conference: 16. November

## Preparation

### Topic

* Environmental impact of developing, operating and using software
* Order of magnitude of carbon reduction various measures

### Claim

* knowing the order of magnitude is the next step forward

### Value for the listeners

* oder of magnitude of measures in specific scenario
* get to know a modelling approach

### Argumentation, Information

* motivation: concerned dev
* did the research, found a lot of measures 

#### Wordcloud Start

carbon awareness
power
green coding
data reduction
utilization
embodied emissions
travel

#### Wordcloud End

mainly: power, travel, embodied emissions, lifespan
less: green coding, sustainable ux, data reduction, 

### About me

* software engineer, cloud architect
* concerend about climate change 
* working on the intersection of software and sustainability

### Invitation

* pick your fights, optimize the right thing (make a basic calculation)

### Overview

* initial wordcloud based on research
* model, example project, 
* calculation layers
* measures applied
* modified wordcloud based on model findings
* optimize the right thing / pick your fights / don't blindly apply what makes sense to you but check
* its challenging to find information
* keep open perspective, include way you work
* guidance about the order of magnitude is the next step forward, call for research


### Abstract

How can you determine the most impactful measure? Let me take you through my journey of assessing the order of magnitude of various measures to make software greener. For a hypothetical business software project, I analyzed the relevant factors in a model, calculated its carbon footprint, and then applied various measures. The results were quite surprising! Let me surprise you too and give you a tool how to do a quick calculation yourself.

### Title

The order of magnitude of green software measures
