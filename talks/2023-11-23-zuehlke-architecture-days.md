# The software architects role in Green IT

After a theoretical overview of the principles of Green Coding and Sustainable Software Engineering, we will apply various measures to a simulated, typical software project so that we can see their order of magnitude. 

Finally we'll discuss what conclusions to draw from that. We will discuss the impact of Software Systems Architecture on Green IT and sound out what we as architects can contribute.

# Agenda

1) I did a carbon simulation for a hypothetical project, present project 
2) Result: 
3) Applied measures to reduce impact (see at `allDecorators.ts`)
4) First finding: usage has a lot o impact, removed
5) measures ordered by impact, devops slides
