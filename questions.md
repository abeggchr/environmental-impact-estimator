## Emissions factors

Emission factor for Azure is 11.52 gCO2eq/kWh (source: CCF), while Switzerland energy mix has an emission factor of 153 gCO2eq/kWh (source: electricitymap, for 2022) - more than 10 times more.
Is this correct?
Why is the emission factor for Azure so much lower?
Can such a low emission factor be achieved for development and users as well?
