Staging environment is dimensioned like the production environment. Differences are:
- there is not hot-standby
- it has another usage pattern
- it is used during development and usage phase

Testing activities:
 * 1h performance test per day (full utilization).
 * 4h of users testing per day (a bit more than no utilization).
