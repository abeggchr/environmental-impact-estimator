### Abstract

At first glance, the IT industry seems to be a relatively clean sector. However, the development and operation of software have a significant environmental impact that is often overlooked. In this talk, we will explore the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated along the software lifecycle, and discuss ways to reduce it with measures ranging from coding over datacenter operation to the way individuals are working. By the end of the presentation, attendees will have an overview of the key factors, as well as actionable suggestions for addressing them.

### Title

The environmental impact of software
